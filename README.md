# TouchTracker

An iPhone app that allows user to draw lines with fingers. The color of each line is determined by the slope of the line and thickness is determined by the speed of dragging fingers. All lines can be deleted with a double tap. A single tap on a particular line allows the user to delete the line. A long press on a line allows the user to move a line.
